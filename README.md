# Chatbot UI

**Chatbot UI** is a lightweight, customizable frontend for interacting with language models, built with **Next.js**. Every [Gaianet node](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node) ships with this UI preconfigured, but itâ€™s also easy to use independently with any LLM API.

## Features

- **Plug-in Any API:** Easily point the UI to your own model or hosted API via environment configuration.
- **Next.js Framework:** Enjoy optimized routing, SSR, and built-in performance with Next.js.
- **Prompt Customization:** Tweak system prompts and interaction flows to match your use case.
- **i18n Support:** Built-in internationalization for multilingual experiences.
